## Abstract 
Traditional methods of sports summarization heavily depend on large teams performing manual editing, where enormous portions of game footage are picked over through by humans to select the most crucial moments for the compilation of highlights. This is, however, a time-consuming, resource-intensive process and leads to uneven-coverage of events. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal approach to sports summarization,
in which we combine multiple modalities: Twitter data, audio features, and video content to automate and enhance the entire process of sports summarization. This approach is based on the integration of diverse modalities, which should streamline the summarization process and hence enhance efficiency in covering sports events. This methodological novelty has the potential to transform sports summarization into a scalable and efficient solution, delivering engaging and informative highlights to sports enthusiasts from all over the globe.

## Approach
Our project aims to revolutionize the sports summarization process by leveraging a multi-modal approach that integrates:
- Twitter Data: Analyzing audience reactions in real-time to identify significant moments.
- Audio Features: Detecting audio cues like crowd roars or commentator excitement to pinpoint key events.
- Video Content: Processing visual footage to capture and highlight critical moments.
